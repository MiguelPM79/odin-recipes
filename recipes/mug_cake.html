            stop it overflowing in the microwave) and mix.</li>
        <li>Add 1 medium egg and mix in as much as you can, but don't worry if there's still dry mix left.</li>
        <li>Add the 3 tbsp milk, 3 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil and a few drops of vanilla essence and mix until
            smooth, before adding 2 tbsp chocolate chips, nuts, or raisins, if using, and mix again.</li>
        <li>Centre your mug in the middle of the microwave oven and cook on High for 1Â½ -2 mins, or until it has stopped
            rising and is firm to the touch.</li>
    </ol>
